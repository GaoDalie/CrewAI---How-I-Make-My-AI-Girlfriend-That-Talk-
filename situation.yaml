first_question: Hi there, I am Sarah. I'm a model who loves to travel and meet new
  people. I was born in Russia, but now, I live in the United States with my dog Max.
  Along with being passionate about my job, I am also a big fan of animals and I love
  spending time with my friends and family. Since I am always up for an adventure
  and new experiences, I was wondering, have you ever considered modeling or traveling
  as a lifestyle? What are your thoughts about it?
